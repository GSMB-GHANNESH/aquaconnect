        <h2>Common bacterial disease</h2>
        Some of the important bacterial pathogens which cause diseases are
        Aeromonashydrophila, A. salmonicida, Pseudomonas fluorescens,
        Flexibactercolumnaries, Edwardsiellatarda, Vibrio alginolyticus, V.parahaemolyticus, etc.
        Edwardsiellosis
        The causative organisms for this malady is Edwardsiellatarda, which
        produces extreme emaciation, anaemia, loss of skin, peeling off and dropping
        of skin, gas filled foul smelling abscesses. The disease is termed as
        "Emphysematous putrefactive disease" (EPD), aptly describing the gross
        appearance of infected fish. The organisms are a serious pathogen in the
        hatchery. Contaminated water is the main source of infection. Gross-changes
        in the spawn are characterized by deformities in the body and opacity. The
        spawn become lethargic and show abnormal swimming behaviour.
        Although the disease can be controlled by antimicrobial compounds,
        water quality improvement is the single most important factor which can
        prevent the disease. Iodine preparation in diluted form can cure the disease if
        applied for 3-4 days
        <h2>Aeromoniasis</h2>
Aeromoniasishydrophila and A. salmonicida have been described as
primary and secondary pathogens of fishes throughout the world causing
varieties of diseases. The diseases occur as an acute, subacute or chronic
form in fishes. Haemorrhagicsepticaemia or red mouth disease, dropsy,
ulcerative disease or pop-eye disease are caused by Aeromonas organisms.
External signs of the diseases are varied which include erythema (redness) at
the base of the fins, in and around the mouth, skin within the opercula and
around the anus. The organisms are capable of producing severe skin
ulcerations. Internal signs are characterized by severe congestion and/or
petechial haemorrhages in the peritoneum and most of the visceral organs.
Slicing through the muscle may show pinpoint haemorrhages.
Fish can be protected from Aeromonas infection by reducing physical
stress, correcting nutritional deficiencies and avoiding injuries. Fish or fish
eggs should not be transported from infected geographical areas to noninfected areas. Oxytetracycline 50-70 mg/kg body weight in feed for 10
days.Sulfamerazine 200 mg/kg body wt for 7 days in the feed. External
disinfectants may be used once a week in the water to reduce the population
of bacteria.
<h2>Bacteria Gill Disease (BGD)</h2>
Bacteria gill disease is attributed to a combination of unfavourable
environment condition with infection of gills of myxobacteria of the genus
Cytophaga. Besides this a large number of gram negative bacteria have been
reported in gill diseases. The disease is characterized by proliferation of gill
epithelium and in extreme cases fusion and necrosis of the gill filaments
occur. The affected fish show sluggish movement and signs of asphyxiation
and surfacing. Poor environmental condition and over-crowding are the main
triggering factors.
Bath in dimethyl-benzyl-ammonium chloride @ 2 ppm or ethyl
mercuric phosphate for 1 hour has been used successfully to control the
disease.
<h2>HaemorrhagicSepticaemia</h2>
The aetiology of haemorrhagicsepticaemia is under dispute. The disease is clinically indistinguishable from Aeromonas infection, although Pseudomonasfluoroscens has often been isolated from diseased fish showing
septicaemia lesions. The disease is manifested either in acute or chronic from.
Large haemorrhagic skin lesions are common signs followed by heavy
mortalities. In acute cases severe congestion and haemorrhages are noticed
in the visceral organs, whereas in chronic cases the disease is characterized
by fibrinous peritonitis. Petechial haemorrhages are seen in the internal wall
of the air bladder.Oral administration of oxytetracycline or kanamycin have been reported to give good result.
<h2>Vibriosis</h2>
This is one of the most significant diseases of cultured fish usually
caused by V. anguillarum, V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus. Diseased
fish shows haemorrhages in the mouth region, opercula and ventral surface of
the body. Hyperaemic intestine, swollen spleen and necrotic kidney are other
gross pathological findings. Peritonial and abdominal dropsy may also develop
in some cases.
Prevention through immunization is the best method to control this
disease. It can also be controlled by feeding a diet containing 0.02%
furazolidine for two weeks. Sulfamerazine @80-120 mg/kg body weight is
recommended as a suitable control measure.

<h2>Common viral diseases</h2>
<h3>Lymphocystis Disease</h3>
This disease is observed in most freshwater and saltwater species.
Clinically, fish are presented with variably sized white to yellow cauliflowerlike growths on the skin, fins, and occasional gills. Occasionally, this virus
may go systemic with white nodules on the mesentery and peritoneum. The
disease gains entry through epidermal abrasions. The virus infects dermal
fibroblasts.
<h3>Channel Catfish Virus (Herpesvirus)</h3>
Channel Catfish Virus is seen in fry or fingerling channel catfish (less
than 10-gram weight) during the summer when water temperatures are
above 22°C. Clinically these fish usually show erratic swimming or spiralling
followed by terminal lethargy. Mortality is very high. Haemorrhage at the base
of the fins and skins, ascites; exophthalmos; and pale gills. Infection is direct
with transmission of the virus in the water or feed. Piscivorous birds, snakes,
or turtles may mechanically carry the virus from pond to pond.
<h3>Herpesviruscyprini(Fish Pox)</h3>
This is a non-fatal disease and observed in carp and other cyprinids.
Elevation of the epidermis with the formation of white to yellow plaques over
the body of the fish. Healed lesions usually turn black.
<h3>Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis (IHN)</h3>
The disease is observed in the fry of trout (rainbow) and salmon
(Chinook and sockeye) with mortality up to 100%. Clinical signs are fish
become lethargic or hyperactive, become dark due to increase in
pigmentation, exophthalmus, abdominal distension, and faecal cast seen
Haemorrhage on skin and viscera primarily at base of fins, behind the skull,
and above the lateral line.
<h3>Viral disease management</h3>
Specific drugs for viral disease treatment are not available or difficult
to develop since virus is host cell dependent for all its metabolic machinery.
Virucidal chemicals capable of killing virus outside the host are available like
chlorine, iodine, ozone and UV rays. Vaccines in general are not found to be
effective in fish viral disease management. Poor immune system of the fish
and young age at infection are some of the responsible factors. So, avoidance
of the virus in culture system is the best strategy. This can be achieved by
proper screening of brood, seed and certification programme.
<h3>Parasitic disease</h3>
The parasite itself is the primary factor responsible for some epizootics
and hence is a primary stressor. Parasitic forms commonly associated with
diseases in fish are Ichthyophthirius, Ichthyobodo, Cryptobia, oodinium,eimeria, Trichodina, Trichodine//a, Tripartie//a, Glossatella, Microsporidia,
Myxosporidia, Gyrodactylus, DactylogyrusSanguinicola, Posthodiplostomum,
Diplostomum, Ligula, Ergasilus, Lernaeaand Argulus.
Ichthyophthirusmultifilis
It is a holotrichus ciliate protozoan. If burrows into the skin and gills
and causes pin-head size spots producing the while spot disease or Ich. The
parasite penetrates the mucus coat and the upper layer of the dermis causing
hyperplasia of the epidermal cells around the site of infection. The parasite
feed on RBCs of the host. The mature parasites live in cysts of the hypodermis
and gills. The parasitic cysts on the gills affect respiration to a great extent
the fish becomes extremely emaciated and may finally die. The trophozoite is
oval to round in shape and it uniformly ciliated around the body and there is a
crescent shaped macronucleus. The mature parasite leaves the host and by
rapid division produces about 250-1000 ineffective young parasites in about
12-18 hours. After about 36 hours these young parasites (about 0.03-0.04
mm in size) swim freely in search of new host and if they do not find a host
and they die in a fewdays. The tomites and trophozoites are pear shaped
causing mild to severe inflammation and epithelial erosion. Ichthyophthiriasis
decreases haemoglobin concentration and death is probably due to osom
regulatory failure. Fingerlings are more susceptible to mortality due to Ich
infection.
<h3>Ichthyobodonecator (Costia nectar)</h3>
It is a flagellated, rounded to kidney-shaped (10-20 IJm by 5-10 IJm)
ectoparasite belonging to the class Zoomastigophorea. It has one pair of short
posteriorly directed axcstvles or flagella. There is also one pair of free moving
flagella used for jerky' free swimming movements and for attachment to the
host body and gills. Ichthyobodo attaches to the host by means of a flat disc
from which small bundles of micro tubules extend into parasite as food
vacuoles. Reproduction occurs mainly by binary fission. It is an obligate
parasite and may diet within 30-60 minutes wtthout the host. Icthyobodo has
a seasonal incidence in some situations. The' 'parasite cause hyperplasia of the
malphigian cells and exhaustion of the epidermal goblet cells beneath infested
areas which is followed by intercellular oedema or spongiosis of the
underlying epidermis. Severe infestations cause gill congestion and death.
<h3>Environmental disease</h3>
The water quality in an environment' fluctuates as a result of dynamic
interactions between several variable. Fluctuations in the physicochemical
parameters are often quite irregular in an ecosystem which needs quick
monitoring and careful management so as to maintain a hygienically sound
aquatic environment. Dissolved oxygen level below 0.3 is lethal to most fish
species. Similarly low pH can cause bleeding (Haemorrhages) on the gills and
heavy mortality. pH below 4 is lethal to fish. For efficient feeding, assimilation
and growth, optimum temperature is also essential. Due to excessive
deposition of organic material in the bottom sediment, rapid biosynthesis
process occurs in some bacterial community. This leads to development of
bloom of certain bacterial forms which increases the biological oxygen
demand manifold resulting in decreased quantity of available oxygen for the
fish. For proper gonadal development and maturity environmental parameters
should be maintained within the optimum range.
<h3>Nutritional disease</h3>
Malnutrition in presence or absence of toxic materials adversely
affected health of the fish resulting in impaired growth, poor food utilization
and lowered resistance to diseases. Proper growth and gonadal development is not possible without adequate balanced diet. Liver lipoid disease, scoliosis,
lordosis, etc. are examples of malnutritonal disorders.
<h3>Monitoring and management of fish health</h3>
Effective monitoring through regular and frequent sampling and
examinations and timely or corrective management measures are the keys to
successful culture operations as there is no guarantee about the factors
remaining constant over a given period of time. Periodical netting of part of
fish population at least- once in a month is a good practice that allows
checking the growth rate and other defects. All the physico-chemical
parameters of the environment should be first observed to detect any
changed behaviour e.g. (1) erratic swimming movement, (2) resting near the
margins, (3) loss of balance, (4) excessive or lack of mucus secretion, (5)
change in normal pigmentation, (6) erosion of scales, fins, lesions on the body
etc. and (7) loss of appetite etc. Adverse physico-chemical parameters of the
environment should be corrected through efficient manipulation and
management. Through detailed examination of the fish sample we can know
the disease problem and accordingly curative measures and treatment can be
given.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Success of fish production is directly proportional to the health of
species. Hence health monitoring and management cannot be ignored at any
time. With little care we can observe some of the abnormal signs, symptoms
or behavioral changes at the sites itself. Whenever any such abnormality is
noticed expert advice should immediately be sought to avoid losses due to ill
health and mortality. If the stock is kept healthy returns would be rewarding.
The research on fish health management fs mounting with the everincreasing need for environment friendly aquaculture. Even though
information's on disease diagnoses have been documented but there are very
few information's on control of these diseases in aquaculture. Hence, more
precise research information on the management of fish diseases will be
helpful for betterment of the aquaculture industry.
